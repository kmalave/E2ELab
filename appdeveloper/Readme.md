## Hands on Lab - Application Development

[<img src="https://github.com/WatsonDataPlatform/E2ELab/blob/master/Media/Deploy.png">](https://github.com/WatsonDataPlatform/E2ELab)

As an Application Developer, you need multiple application and data services that facilitate a modern architecture and delivery practices around mobile, microservices, DevOps and continuous delivery. The hands-on exercises in this lab will instruct you on how to quickly build and deploy a live dashboard application with Node.js connceted to a document data service, IBM Cloudant NoSQL DB. It analyzes data stored in the Cloudant document data service and renders a web interface that displays a graph depicting where time is being spent across the different departments of the Great Outdoors retail store.

## Prerequisites

> Make sure you have completed the prerequisites in the GettingStarted section for the labs before you proceed.
> ### [Click Here to go to GettingStarted](https://github.com/WatsonDataPlatform/E2ELab/tree/master/GettingStarted/)

## Workflow

    a.  Allow the page to completely refresh all the code changes. You should see 12 files selected in the right-hand pane.  One change should be the changes you made to the **Manifest.yml** file.

    b.  Enter a comment into the comment window and click **Commit**.

    c.  In the **Outgoing** source tab on the left side of the page click **Push**. This will deliver (push) the commits to the server.

    a.  Go back up one level and select and select **Delivery pipeline** tools box.

    b.  Click the play button on the **Build stage** to build the newly delivered code. If the build is successful the Deploy stage should start automatically and deploy your code to the server.

    c.  Once the Deploy stage has completed and passed, right click on the application URL and **open in a new browser tab** by right clicking on the URL.

12.  Node.js runtime Service

    a.  Browse to your mybluemix.net URL where your web application is hosted. You should see a d3.js graph with 5 bars representing the 5 zones in the store.

    b.  After 30 seconds, the application should read from the Cloudant database and the values for each store should change.
