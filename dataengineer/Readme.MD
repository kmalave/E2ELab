## Hands on Lab - Data Engineer

[<img src="https://github.com/WatsonDataPlatform/E2ELab/blob/master/Media/DataPreparation.png">](https://github.com/WatsonDataPlatform/E2ELab)

As a Data Engineer, you are challenged with the constant and expediated task of delivering quality, trusted data to business analytsts, data scientists and application developers. Time is always of the essence, so you need the ablity to quickly and easily find, access, prepare, cleanse and standardize data and deliver it to those who need it when they need it in support of business analytical and application use cases.

The IBM Bluemix Data Connect service, an intergral component of the Watson Data Platform, helps tackle these challenges.

Bluemix Data Connect is a fully managed self-service, data preparation and integration service that empowers users to easily streamline analytical and application development projects to deliver insights faster and with increased accuracy. It provides a wide range of data access connectors to your most essential data sources wherever they reside; on the cloud or on-premises, so you can explore, combine, and shape your data to prepare it for analytics. Use it to positively impact the way your organization leverages valuable data resources - all from the convenience of the cloud.

Data Connect is managed by IBM in the cloud, so you can sleep better at night, with Pay-as-you-go and subscription pricing options to get started quickly. It’s powered by Spark for a speedy and responsive experience and can easily integrate data across different platforms and is seamlessly integrated with Watson Analytics. Bluemix Data Connect empowers non-technical and technical users to simply put data to work.

With Data Connect, Data Engineers can enable self-service data access to end users using elastic deployment through the cloud and delver the data faster while maintaining important controls such as data governance and security. This allows them to break free from routine data requests and focus on additional value for an organization such as implementing and enforcing corporate standards, security, data governance and complex requirements. Data Connect saves time and resources by reducing the effort to provision trusted data and make it fit for use.

This lab will demonstrate how a data engineer can easily utilize these capabilities of the Data Connect service:

* Creating and working with Data Connect connectors
*	Visualizing and understanding data quality and Content
*	Preparing and transforming data
*	Executing and monitoring data activities
* Persiting data into Watson Analytics

## Workflow

> On the following pages are a series of steps to complete this lab sucessfully. Each step outlines an easy to follow set of instructions that demonstrate the capabilities of the Bluemix Data Connect cloud service. It has been designed as a serial process so it’s important that you follow each step in sequence and do not deviate from the workflow or skip any steps in the process.

## Step 1: Launch the Data Connect Service

### [Click Here to Go to Bluemix](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/)

<img src="./media/Step1-image-01.png"/>

> You should be logged into your Bluemix account if you just completed the GettingStarted section. If not, select the Log in button. When prompted, supply your credentials to log into your Bluemix account.

<img src="./media/Step1-image-02.png"/>

> Make sure you are in the "Watson Data Platform" space that you were instructed to create in the GettingStarted section. If you are not in the "Watson Data Platform" space, switch to it by followimg the instructions below.

<img src="./media/Step1-image-03.png"/>

1. **Select** the Bluemix region / organization area in the top right corner of the Bluemix home page.
2. **Select** the arrow in the Space drop down list box.
3. **Select** the "Watson Data Platform" space. Bluemix will switch yuo to the selected space.

<img src="./media/Step1-image-04.png"/>

1. Once you are logged into your Bluemix account and in the "Watson Data Platform" space, **Scroll down** to the "All Services" section of your dashboard and **Click On** the "WDP Data Connect" service. You will be brought to the Data Connect launch page.

<img src="./media/Step1-image-05.png" />

2. **Select** the “LAUNCH” button to start using the Data Connect service. It will open in a new tab in your browser.

<img src="./media/Step1-image-06.png"/>

> The first time you enter the Data Connect service interface you are presented with a "Welcome to Data Connect!" getting started tour to introduce you to the functionality provided by the service.

1. **Click through** the Welcome experience using the arrows in the bottom right corner of the dialog.  
2. **Select** the "X" in the top right corner of the dialog when you are finished exploring.  

<img src="./media/Step1-image-07.png"/>

> The Data Connect user interface provides easy access to all functions from a main menu located on the left side and a few primary functions that are displayed in the middle of the home page that allow you to navigate to the different areas of the interface.
>
> **Notice** that there is a menu control button to the right of the Data Connect service name. It controls the appearance of the menu on the left side. By selecting this button you can hide or view the left side menu. Also, clicking on the service name you can always get back to the home page. Let’s experiment with these controls.

1. **Select** the menu control button. The menu will disappear. Select it again and the menu will reappear.  
2. **Select** the Activities menu item. It will take you to the Activities section of the interface.  
3. **Select** the Data Connect service name to get back to the home page.

## Step 2: Create a Watson Analytics Connection

<img src="./media/Step2-image-01.png"/>

1. **Select** the “Connections” link at the bottom of the home page.  

<img src="./media/Step2-image-02.png"/>

2. **Select** the “IBM Watson Analytics” connector from the list of connectors.

<img src="./media/Step2-image-03.png"/>

> **Note** - Data Connect does not require you to enter a Watson Analytics user ID or password when creating a connection to Watson Analytics. It communicates with Watson Analytics using the cloud OAuth2 API and uses your Bluemix credentials to authenticate. Therefore, the connection creation may fail if you do not have a Watson Analytics account with credentials (user and password) that matches the Bluemix account you used to launch Data Connect.
>
>Also, during authentication, a new browser session will appear when Data Connect communicates with Watson Analytics to validate your credentials.

3. **Enter** "Watson Analytics" (without quotes) for the Connection name.  
4. **Enter** "My Watson Analytic Account" (without quotes) for the Description.
5. **Select** the "CA1-Toronto" Data Center.
6. **Select** the "Create Connection" button.

<img src="./media/Step2-image-04.png"/>

> If successful, you will receive a message that “The connection Watson Analytics was created.”

<img src="./media/Step2-image-05.png"/>

> Otherwise, you will receive the error screen above. There can be several reasons for this:
>
> 1. You **don't** have a Watson Analytics account with credentials that match your Bluemix account. If so, close the browser window that contains the error and go back to the [GettingStarted](https://github.com/WatsonDataPlatform/E2ELab/tree/master/GettingStarted/) section and follow the instructions to create a Watson Analytics account using your Bluemix credentials.
>
> 2. Your Watson Analytics account is not hosted in the **CA1-Toronto** data center I instructed you to select. Close the browser window that contains the error. Go back to the Data Conect service interface and try the **US1-Dallas** or **EU1-Amsterdam** data center and select the "Create Connection" button until it succeeds.

## Step 3: Import the Source Dataset

<img src="./media/Step3-image-01.png"/>
